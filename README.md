# ViewTube - An Extension for Visualizing the Views-to-Likes Ratio of YouTube Videos

## Overview

**ViewTube** is a browser extension designed to display the ratio of a YouTube video's count of 'views' to its amount of 'likes'. All information relevant to this metric is obtained solely/entirely from the video's rendered page itself, and the resulting visualization is equally embedded directly within its interface - thus making **ViewTube** operate /entirely/ without the need for access to personal data, and/or YouTube's (or any other external) APIs.

## Features

- **Data Presentation**: This extension dynamically presents the ratio of view counts to like counts derived directly from the currently viewed video's page. This information is intended to provide users with quick insights into the video's engagement metrics without navigating away from the video itself.
- **Non-intrusive**: Information is retrieved from the rendered webpage of the current video, ensuring the process is unobtrusive and respects user privacy, as well as YouTube's terms of service.
- **No Data Storage**: No video-specific information is stored by this extension, ensuring that each viewing session remains independent and private.
- **User Data Privacy**: This extension does not access, process, or store any user-specific information. The only settings retained pertain to functional preferences, such as the 'on/off state' when activating or deactivating the extension.

## User Privacy and Data Policy

This extension has been designed with a privacy-first approach, ensuring that user data integrity and privacy are preserved. Here's how:

- **No User Data Collection**: This extension does not collect, process, or store any personally identifiable information. All functionality is designed to operate without the need for user data.
- **Functional Data**: The only information retained by **ViewTube** pertains to operational settings (e.g., whether the extension is activated or deactivated), which are essential for user preferences and do not involve any personal or sensitive data.
- **No External Data Retrieval**: Since this extension does not utilize YouTube's or any external APIs, it operates independently of any data collection frameworks.
